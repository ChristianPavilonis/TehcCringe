SEATTLE - Junior developer Felix Box, at a fintech startup, received his biggest task a few weeks ago. The assignment was to implement a design, but centering one div became the unexpected challenge. “I though only a Sr. developer could figure out how to center a div, but I was willing to try.” Felix told his project manager that the task might take him three weeks, but he was able to complete it in only six workdays. His PR contained only 30 lines of CSS and three more npm dependencies.

Though he has not yet received the title of senior developer at his current employer, he felt it was appropriate to update his LinkedIn profile to more accurately reflect his innate ability.

Since updating his profile he has received more profile visits, more InMessages, and appeared in more search results. All well deserved after such an impressive accomplishment.
