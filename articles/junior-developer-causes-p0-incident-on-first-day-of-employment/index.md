On his first day of employment, [Scott Wu](https://x.com/ScottWu46)'s son [Devin Wu](https://x.com/cognition_labs) was hired as a junior developer at [TheStartup™](https://x.com/ThePrimeagen).

During his first pair programming session, Devin attempted to push directly to the master branch [under influence of his employer](https://x.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1867265706254807388). Thanks to branch protection rules, Devin was unable to push directly to the master branch and instead gave up after eleven minutes.

Shortly after, Devin accidentally leaked sensitive credentials during [Daily Standup](https://twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen). Devin's manager immediately deleted all recordings of the meeting and tattle-taled straight to Devin's father.

Scott Wu, Devin's legal guardian, was furious with Devin's rash actions and gave Devin a good paddlin' as well as legally terminating his employment with TheStartup™.

After setting off a PagerDuty alert and waking up a lot of sleeping underpaid Indian 10X developers, Scott was able to teach Devin a good lesson. [ThePrimeagen](https://x.com/ThePrimeagen), CEO of TheStartup™, forgave Devin and allowed him to continue working for him.
