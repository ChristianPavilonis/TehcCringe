**TEXAS** - On a sunny Dallas morning Aaron Francis noticed a little old lady struggling to cross the street, so he proceeded to walk over to assist her.

Once the light (for humans) turned green, they both started staggering across the street. Aaron, not having anything better to say, asked "Ma'am, do you happen to know what a Binary Tree is?"

Before she could answer, he explained in detail how Binary Trees worked.

Thank Heavens they reached the end of the street because Aaron was about to start talking about why BTreeMaps were better than HashMaps.

"He was the nicest young man," said the old lady, "but my hearing aids ran out of battery so I couldn't hear him."
