[Terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop), a Silicon-Valley startup probably backed by YC, announced a new **Skill Issue** coffee flavor in honor of their decision to migrate to GraphQL.

To make a purchase on Terminal.shop, customers will use the command `ssh terminal.shop` and enter their personal information such as credit card number, address, etc.

To the disappointment of their customer base, the new Skill Issue flavor can is only available for purchase through their new VSC*de extension.
