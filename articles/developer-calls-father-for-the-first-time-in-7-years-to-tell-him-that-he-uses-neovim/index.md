**AUSTIN, TX** - H.J. Kelle, a junior developer who recently switched to Neovim, reconnected with his father for the first time in 7 years since his parents divorce to tell him that he uses Neovim btw.

"He, was sobbing on the phone, I couldn't make out what he was saying, but I think he was very proud of me," H.J told us, "He mentioned making up for lost time, I said 'Of course I make up for the lost time configuring with how fast I am with vim motions!'"

He has also reached out to the teacher that told him he wouldn't amount to anything, his best friend's mom, and his grandmother in the nursing home with the same message.

Next, H.J. plans to reach out to the one girl from his 11th grade physics class. He is sure his new found elite status will finally impress her.
