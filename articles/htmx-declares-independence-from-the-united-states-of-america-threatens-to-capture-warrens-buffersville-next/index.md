In a historic battle with the Intercoolers, the HTMXers army emerged victorious and took control of the U.S. state of Montana. With no resistance from the American army, the state of Montana was declared independent as the "Republic of the Horse Company" with its capital at Billings, now renamed to WFT.

The president of this new country and the only HTMX CEO with real powers, Carson Gross, issued a warning to his next-door neighbor [Warren Buffering](https://x.com/WarrenInTheBuff), threatening to capture Buffersville in Canada.

Unable to speak, Warren has yet to respond. For now, the situation is tense.
