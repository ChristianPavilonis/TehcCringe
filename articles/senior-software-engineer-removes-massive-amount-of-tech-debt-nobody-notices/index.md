A Senior Software Engineer at a major tech company created a Jira ticket to remove a massive amount of tech debt after attempting to justify his actions to the Project Manager over the course of six meetings.

The Project Manager, who wasn't exactly happy that the engineer would not spend his time shipping new AI features, assigned a single story point to the Jira ticket.

After a long day of meetings, the engineer opened a six-pack of Monster Energy drinks and proceeded to pull an all-nighter to create an enourmous red Pull Request to complete the task.

"This PR," he wrote in the description, "aims to remove a lot of redundant, unperformant, and unnecessary code that was created over the course of the last fifteen years. Thoroughly tested across multiple environments and devices. Closes #18734, #4754, #20023, #12374".

CI was green, so all the reviewers instantly approved the PR.

After having been loaded onto a merge queue, squeezed through the staging environment, and finally passing through QA, the PR would finally make its way into production.

The Project Manager closed the ticket. Work continued as usual. The amount of merge conflicts spiked. Users said nothing.

"I wish that the release manager would have maybe taken a few seconds to mention my optimizations in the release notes, but it's done.", said the engineer.
