**BOSEMAN, MONTANA** â€“ Carson Gross, CEO and founder of [Intercooler.js](https://intercoolerjs.org/), is suing Carson Gross' [HTMX](https://htmx.org/?ads=true) for "stealing my ideas and claiming ownership. Unfair!"

In response to the allegations, Carson Gross stated, "Look at this nerd ragin'."

Many are saying that Intercooler is an outdated jQuery relic, while HTMX is the future of web development.

All 1,074 [CEOs of HTMX](https://htmx.ceo/) are set to give depositions next week during court proceedings.

According to leaked emails, the CEOs must pay their own travel expenses due to funds being tied up in the lawsuit. When [Warren Buffering](https://x.com/WarrenInTheBuff) complained about paying for travel, the other CEOs responded, "Shut up, Warren!"

Carson Gross is set to speak in defense of HTMX after Gross' opening statements on behalf of Intercooler next Monday. Stay tuned for updates.
