After threatening to release an embarrassing SORA-generated AI video of Sam Altman, an anonymous source claims that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) internally predicted a possible earthquake and tsunami around the San Francisco Bay Area.

In response to the news, OpenAI hustled to get a new whopping $200/month ChatGPT Pro plan across the line to prepare for potential victims.

"I guess I could have used our funding for that", said Sam Altman (CEO and Founder of OpenAI), "But our investors would immediately cut our funding".
