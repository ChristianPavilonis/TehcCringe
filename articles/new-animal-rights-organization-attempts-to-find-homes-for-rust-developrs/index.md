A concern was raised to [Peta](https://uncyclopedia.com/wiki/People_Eating_Tasty_Animals) about stray rust programmers running wild all over the streets.

"It's such a tragedy," said a spokesperson "to see all these unemployed rust developers not being productive."

After successfully obtaining some stray money from YC, Peta managed to rent three 1000-square-foot houses in the SF bay area to dump the rust developers in.

Shortly after, Peta was sued by the Rust Foundation for violating their trademark policy.
