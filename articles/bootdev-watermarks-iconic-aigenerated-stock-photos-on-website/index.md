After [someone](https://x.com/IroncladDev) did a little bit of inspect element magic on https://boot.dev to extract the URL of a stock photo and using it in a [100% lawful manner](https://x.com/TehcCringe/status/1870501840636223821), [A corrupt police officer abusing their authority](https://x.com/badcop_) threatened to [file a lawsuit](https://x.com/bootdotdev/status/1870692933617520914) over trademark infringement.

When the police officer asked [Lane](https://x.com/wagslane) (CEO and founder of boot dot dev) to use some VC funding to hire a lawyer, he refused saying "The stock photo in question is MY PROFILE BANNER and you want to SUE SOMEONE FOR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT when it DOESN'T EVEN HAVE OUR LOGO ON IT-----"

It was at this point that Lane realized that they had not watermarked the stock photo at all.

"I'm not a lawyer," he said, "or a designer, but I definitely know how use CSS to position our logo on the image, take a screenshot, and then re-upload it to boot.dev." Unfortunately, that was exactly what he did.

This caused a lot of backlash and churn from boot.dev users.
