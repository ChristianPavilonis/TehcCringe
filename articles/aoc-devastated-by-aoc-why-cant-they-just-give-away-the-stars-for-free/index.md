After logging into [X](https://x.com) (formerly Twitter) on December 1st, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was shocked to see that the programming community started talking about her.

To her utter disappointment, she realized they were talking about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Wanting to please the programming community and maybe muster a few additional votes, she committed to attempt Advent of Code.

After creating a [GitHub](https://github.com) account over the course of an hour, she read the instructions and downloaded the input for day one.

Eight hours later, after typing numbers into Microsoft Word and her calculator, she entered her solution and got **one gold star**.

The second half of the puzzle presented itself to her.

AOC looked out the window at the setting sun and realized she hadn't eaten all day.

Realizing her fate, she burst into tears.

"why can’t they just give away the stars for free?"
