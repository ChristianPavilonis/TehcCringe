Officials were notified of highly disturbing scratching, banging, and screaming noises coming from an abandoned datacenter. Shortly after, a rescue team was dispatched to break into the room where the noises were coming from.

The rescue team managed to get the door open and immediately found a man later identified as [Nate Emerson](https://x.com/Nateemerson) sitting cross-legged on the floor, sobbing with an O'Reilly book in his lap. In the corner, the rescue team spotted a woman later identified as [Soychotic](https://x.com/soychotic) casually twisting together a whip with HDMI cables.

Both were promptly arrested for tresspassing on private property.

After putting together the footage from multiple security cameras around ther area, officials confirm that the individualslocked in the room were led there by someone laying down a trail of McDonald's fries & React stickers and were then locked in the room. Detectives managed to identify the person in the footage as [Trav](https://x.com/techsavvytravvy), who was immediately arrested and charged for human trafficking and tresspassing on private property.

"I just wanted Nate to learn about Scrum," Trav would later confess.
