In a surprising turn of events Cursor, the AI powered VS Code fork, has decided to ditch its business model of helping developers write boilerplate code in favor of what many thought was just a fad, NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens).

The announcement came via a post on the X platform: "We're thrilled to announce CursorPunks an NFT collection on the Solana blockchain!"

Michael Truell, co-founder of the company later announced that they will not continue development of the editor and will focus on web3 instead of AI. "The team realized that AI is all just hype. The real innovation is in the NFT market."

When addressing critics he told us "These collectables are far more useful to people's lives than any code that our users generated with AI. It's a true innovation."

Over the next few months, Cursor will shift gears to "CursorPunks," an NFT collection of stylish cursor images. Fans can look forward to owning a unique mouse cursor they can continue to code with in a different editor.
