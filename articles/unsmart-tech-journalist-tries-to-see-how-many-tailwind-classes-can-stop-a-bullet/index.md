NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - A tech journalist named [Christian Pavilonis](https://x.com/ChristianThePav) was arrested after attempting to shoot an ultrawide monitor with a [50 Caliber Barrett Sniper Rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_M82) at point blank range in his back yard.

He later admitted to have been filming a youtube video of himself trying to see how many Tailwind CSS classes could stop a bullet. Not having anything better to say while in the police station, he proceeded to tell the officer all about his experiment.

"I first copy-pasted some code from the tailwind website into VSC*de, put it on a table, then shot it with my .22 caliber pistol," he said. "I was shooting at a distance of about five meters so I didn't need to aim. The .22 did not penetrate the tailwind classes."

Christian continued to ramble on about how he made the tailwind classes longer and longer until certain bullets wouldn't even dent the monitor and how he would increase the caliber once hitting a limit.

"I finally made it to the 50 Caliber Barrett Sniper Rifle," said Christian, ", that you guys took as evidence, but the recoil was so strong that I missed the monitor. I hope the stray bullet hit a UFO or something."

After obtaining a warrant to search Christian's house, police later found a 40-millimeter grenade launcher along with all the other weapons he had used.

"I was really looking forward to trying out my new grenade launcher on the monitor," said Christian, "but coming to think about it, I'm glad I didn't do it at such a short range."

He was later sentenced to six months of house arrest at his mom's house.
