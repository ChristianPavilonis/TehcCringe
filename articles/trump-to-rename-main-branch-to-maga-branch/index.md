**WASHINGTON, D.C. -** In a press conference this week, President Trump announced that he has ordered all main branches to be renamed to MAGA branch.

"To further combat wokeness in software development, I have signed an executive action to rename all branches called 'main' to now be called 'MAGA,'" the President stated. "MAGA, it stands for Make America Great Again, who could be against that? It's a good reminder to software engineers, and we have the best engineers in the world, just wonderful, that they should be doing their best to make America great again. That's what we're doing."

He also floated the idea of forcing Oracle to rename JavaScript to FreedomScript, Python to GadsdenLang, and to tariff Docker containers made in Canada.
