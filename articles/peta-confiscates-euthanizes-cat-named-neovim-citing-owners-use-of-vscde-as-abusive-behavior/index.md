A woman named [Ayla Croft](https://x.com/aylacroft) named her cat 'Neovim' after the [Unfathomably based text editor](https://neovim.io/).

A SWAT team under orders by [PETA](https://uncyclopedia.com/wiki/Peta) (People Eating Tasty Animals) was deployed to her home to confiscate the cat.

The cat was euthanized after the owner was found to have used VSC*de in front of the cat.

"No animal should under any circumstances be exposed to the horrors of Visual Studio Code," an official from PETA stated.
