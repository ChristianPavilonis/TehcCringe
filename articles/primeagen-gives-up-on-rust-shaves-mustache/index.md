In a recent [video](https://youtu.be/1Di8X2vRNRE?si=SAc71iyuOlrm8GlB) on [ThePrimeTime](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen), [ThePrimeagen](https://x.com/ThePrimeagen) announced that he didn't want to program in Rust anymore.

He explained that he didn't want to deal with all the skill issues of Rust, and that [Rust Twitter](https://x.com/anthrocon) didn't like him.

"I just don't want to write Rust anymore," he said. "Bleugh."

After announcing his decision, which he said "might end up being a lie", he proceeded to shave his mustache "because it was furry".
