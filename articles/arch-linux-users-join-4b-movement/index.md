In the new social trend known as the 4b movement, in which women abstain from sex and relationships with men, there are new supporters that are predominantly comprised of men: **Arch Linux users.** 

One Arch user stated to us: "I 100% support women deciding to take a break from relationships all together. I'm doing the same to spend much needed time ricing my setup." Arch users are supporting the movement by also be taking a break from relationships with the opposite sex. Some claim that their "break" has started long before the 4b movement began.
