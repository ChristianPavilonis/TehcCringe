EARTH - Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of Amazon, has been removed from the list of the richest people in the world after allegedly leaving an AWS EC2 instance running for over a year.

Sources confirm that the alleged incident occurred after an AWS employee borrowed Bezos' credit card for a stress test.

"I can't believe," said Bezos after finding out he had been removed from the Billionaires list, "I didn't think of using the free tier for the stress test."

Shortly after, Jeff's net worth was restored to its original value after someone else left an EC2 instance runnning.
