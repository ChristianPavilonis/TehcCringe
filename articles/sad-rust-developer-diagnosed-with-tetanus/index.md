**CHINA** - A Chinese Rust Programmer with a great [Social Credit Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System) merged a large PR to the `mao-zedong` branch on [Guthib](https://guthib.com) (not to be confused with [Github](https://github.com), a chinese knockoff of [GitHub](https://github.com).

His social credit score was just high enough that he could import a [Ferris Plushie](https://www.rustacean.net/) from the [Capitalist Pigs](https://uncyclopedia.com/wiki/Capitalism) in the [United States](https://uncyclopedia.com/wiki/Soviet_Union).

After getting approval from the [ATF](https://uncyclopedia.com/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives) to import the plushie, he proceeded to wait for it to arrive in one of [Temu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temu)'s landfills.

When the package finally arrived, he ran outside to retrieve it, accidentally stepping on a rusty nail in the process.

He was then taken to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with [Tetanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus).

"The onry cure," said the doctor, "is to stay away from any sort of rust for tree reeks."

The Rust Programmer was so shocked by the news that he immediately started to `panic!()`. After having been calmed down with some [Opium](https://uncyclopedia.com/wiki/Opium), the doctor encouraged him to call in sick and use some of his PTO (paid time off) to recover.

After getting back to work, his social credit score had plummeted, and his queue filled with merge conflicts and branches that had to be rebased.
