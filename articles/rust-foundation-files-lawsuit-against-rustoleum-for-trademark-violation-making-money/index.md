The Board Members of the Rust Foundation have been working day and night to establish an authoritarian regime on all consumers of Rust similar to that of [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini).

In their recent actions, the Rust Foundation has stated that entities are not allowed to use the Rust logo, name, or any other aspect that could result in false affiliation.

Some thigh-high-sock users of the Rust Foundation who have never seen a can of WD-40 in their entire lives have brought Rust-Oleum to the attention of the Board Members.

After checking the string "Rust-Oleum" against the [Official Regex for Detecting Rust Trademark Violations](#official-regex-for-detecting-rust-trademark-violations), the Board concluded that Rust-Oleum was violating the trademark.

Rust-Oleum also violated the trademark policy by making money whilst including the "Rust-" prefix in their name.
