**NEW YORK** - The creator of TailwindCSS, Adam Wathan, has rented the billboard on the Marriott Marquis while working on a redesign of Tailwind's homepage. According to Wathan, it's "so I can see all of my classes on a single screen without needing to side-scroll."

The 25,000-square-foot billboard spans 77.69 by 329.65 feet, providing plenty of space for his markup and class names.

Wathan's new setup sets him back around $184,000 a day. "It's nothing compared to the productivity gains," he said. Yesterday, he tweeted a picture of his workspace with the caption: "What's stopping you from coding like this?"
