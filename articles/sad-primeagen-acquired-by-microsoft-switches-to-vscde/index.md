After being caught in 4k using a Microsoft-owned super-bloated version of [Neovim](https://x.com/Neovim) that renders a GUI lacking in border-radius (VSC*de), many are suspecting that [ThePrimeagen](https://x.com/theo) has been acquired by Microsoft.

Experts confirm that ThePrimeagen has **probably** been paid an unholy amount of money by Microsoft to QA Test and Market [Devin](https://x.com/ScottWu46).

Fans are unsure if his employment under [Bill Gates](https://x.com/BillGates), if any, will continue or if Microsoft will go with another candidate.

"I don't understand", claims an anonymous source, "why Microsoft would offer a job to such a big skill issue when they can just hire Devin instead."
