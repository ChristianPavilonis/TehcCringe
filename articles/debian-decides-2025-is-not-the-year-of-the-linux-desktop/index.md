A [recent announcement](https://x.com/debian/status/1884897431894323375) posted from the official [Debian Project](https://x.com/debian) states that they will no longer post on X.

[Conspiracy](https://x.com/keyladelslay) theorists suspect that Debian is migrating away from [X dot com the everything app](https://x.com) due to extensive reddit usage [[source]](https://x.com/keyladelslay/status/1885327455013265704).

Others are considering the fact that maybe the obese maintainers of debian with neckbeards became sad when someone said that the [C Programming Language was Mid](https://x.com/IroncladDev/status/1835294863140553196).

In conclusion, maybe Debian's marketing team consists primarily of europeans that have taken a disliking to all the e/acc people because instinctively europeans don't like to accelerate, but the full reason behind abandoning an account with almost 300,000 followers remains stupid.
