As the [famous saying](https://x.com/htmx_org/status/1721606013902618771) by [Carson Gross](https://x.com/htmx_org) (CEO and founder of HTMX) goes, "Trust No One, not even yourself".

In a recent turn of events, one of the [1074 CEOs of HTMX](https://htmx.ceo) was assassinated, proving this prophetic quote to be true.

Carson Gross has confirmed that he and 979 of his CEOs are in perfect health (93 of them called in sick). 

"I was shocked", he said, "that one of my CEOs would be this much of a skill issue. I suspect that he must be a spy for [Intercooler.js](https://x.com/intercoolerjs)."

The FBI has been heads-over-tails grilling each and every CEO of HTMX in attempt to find a suspect and have yet to release a name.
