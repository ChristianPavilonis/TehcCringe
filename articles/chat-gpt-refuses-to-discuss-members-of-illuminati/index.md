Users of the popular AI chat tool, ChatGPT, discovered a strange quirk this week: it refuses to name any current members of the Illuminati. Most notably no one could get it to mention the name David Mayer, a Rothschild decedent. 

Chat GPT also refuses to talk about what really happens at Bohemian Grove, the Denver airport, or what the movie "National Treasure" was about.

This has sparked numerous conspiracy theories about why OpenAI's chatbot avoids discussing the group, many speculate that it's in on the secrets. Some have noted that as soon as you bring up the group, the AI slows down, as though it's choosing it's words very carefully. One user claimed that his screen began to flicker while discussing the moon landing.

However, legal experts suggest the restrictions may be due to "Right to be a Secret Society" laws, while some critics claim it's Big Tech's attempt to distract us from asking the most important question: are birds real?
