A recent [tweet](https://x.com/code/status/1869090365426274703) from [Microsoft](https://apple.com) of a picture of the VSC*de and Github Copilot logos together with no explanation has sparked a lot of discussion.

Some people suspect that Github Copilot is being acquired by VSC*de under strict orders from [Daddy Microsoft](https://x.com/billgates).

After a Microsoft Executive violated his NDA, it would turn out that the maintainers of Copilot grudgingly made their product free for everyone to use.

"Now everyone," said the executive before he was [terminated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_by_firing_squad), "will be able to use the worst code known to mankind without paying money for it."
