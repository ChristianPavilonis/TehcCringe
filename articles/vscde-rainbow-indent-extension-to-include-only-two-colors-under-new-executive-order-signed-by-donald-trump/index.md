Within a mere 72 hours of his presidency, [Donald Trump](https://x.com/JoeBiden), the 47th president of the United States, signed an executive order requiring the maintainers of the [Rainbow Indent](https://github.com/TheGLander/indent-rainbowline.nvim) VSC*de extension to update the extension to only use two colors, red and blue.

"It has come to my attention that the woke agenda has reached Visual Studio Code, the industry standard for many American Coders," said the President.

"Looks like we got all these crazy colors in developers' code. Total chaos, folks."

"So, here's the deal. We're making an executive decision."

"Only two colors allowed: red and blue."

"We're gonna keep it simple and patriotic, folks."

"Make those indents great again. Just red. Just blue."

"Nice and strong, the way it should be!"

Existing consumers of the extension have a 30-day notice to update the extension or register it with the ATF. Failure to comply will result in seizing of assets and possibly deportation.
