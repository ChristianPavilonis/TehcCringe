After nobody asking, Microsoft has once again created a wrapper around one of OpenAI's newest models in one of their products. Since the product management team can't think of any other names, they once again decided to name this new AI feature "Copilot."

This naming convention is very consistent and is known to cause confusion among users, especially grandmas who don't know how to log in with their username and password.
