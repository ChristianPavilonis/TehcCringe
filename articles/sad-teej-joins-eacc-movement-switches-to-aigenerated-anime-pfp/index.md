As the famous saying by a lot of e/acc / tpot users goes, "You can just do things".

Teej used this line in a recent [tweet](https://x.com/teej_dv/status/1871892397971673470), officially marking the start of himself joining the e/acc movement.

Side effects of joining e/acc include switching to an anime profile picture, repeatedly using the phrase "you can just do things", and getting converted into a weeb, experts confirm.
