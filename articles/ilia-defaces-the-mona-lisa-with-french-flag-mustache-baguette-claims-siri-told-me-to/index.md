PARIS, FRANCE - [Ilia](https://x.com/iliaaamiri), an average frenchman, was arrested for placing multiple large stickers on the Mona Lisa including a French Flag, Mustache, Baguette, and French Hat.

Ilia would later confess that Siri instructed him to deface the Mona Lisa after asking it how to stop being French.

According to Siri, performing the sacred (and illegal) ritual of destroying a fine piece of french artwork with french symbols would rid him of his citizenship.

Instead, Ilia's actions are now recognized as the most french thing anyone could ever do.

He was ultimately charged with being french and was sentenced to eating baguettes and water in prison for life.
