The style guide for writing TehcCringe articles

## headlines

Article headlines are the first and most important element of the article.

1. **short and sweet** - the headline should be short, concise, and to the point
2. **use present tense** - even for past events, present tense is preferred to make the headline more engaging
3. **use emotional words** - emotional words like "horrifying", "shocking", "terrifying", "heartbreaking", etc are preferred
1. **capitalization** - capitalize the first word and proper nouns
2. **no period at the end** - don't add a period at the end of the headline
3. **abbreviations** - avoid using abbreviations unless they are widely recognized

## cover images

The cover image is often the first thing people see and should be treated as one of the primary elements of the article.

- **relevancy** - the cover image should be relevant to the article headline
- **size** - cover images should be a minimum of 878x497 pixels
- **dimensions** - landscape and square images are allowed, portrait images are not. For the nerds out there, this means that the image's height must be less than or equal to its width
- **avoid AI-generated images** - poorly-photoshopped images are generally preferred over AI-generated images. Images generated with AI are allowed, but are usually not as funny.
- **layers, scenes, and splits** - add a border between layers, scenes, and splits to provide a better contrast to each part. See the examples below: 
    - **splits**

    - **scenes**
    - ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gd2SZhiWYAAKCvd?format=jpg&name=medium)
    - **layers**
    - ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdzxFMPX0DMS-fV?format=jpg&name=medium)
- **watermarking** - watermarking cover images with your name/logo/profile image is discouraged. The [dingboard](https://dingboard.com) watermark is an exception.

## article content

Only a small percentage of viewers will click on the link to read an article. In order to spike interest, the headline and cover image have to be a real banger.

- **relevancy** - the article should be relevant to the headline and cover image
- **length** - articles should generally be short with a range of 150-500 words
- **avoid AI-generated content** - nobody wants to read a cheesy article that was generated by chatgippity
- **tone** - use a formal tone with correct grammar and punctuation. Avoid slang and profanity. [Uncyclopedia](https://uncyclopedia.com) has a great article on [how to be funny and not just stupid](https://uncyclopedia.com/wiki/Uncyclopedia:How_To_Be_Funny_And_Not_Just_Stupid) that's worth a read.
